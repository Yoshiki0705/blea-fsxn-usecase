## Deployment Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: SnapLock Volume — Missing StorageEfficiencyEnabled

**Error**: `Parameter validation failed: Missing required parameter in OntapConfiguration: "StorageEfficiencyEnabled"`

**Root Cause**: CfnVolume requires `storageEfficiencyEnabled` even for SnapLock volumes.

**Fix**: Added `storageEfficiencyEnabled: 'true'` to SnapLock volume construct.

**Added to**: `.kiro/steering/fsxn-deployment-lessons.md` (Lesson #11)

### Issue 2: SnapVault Custom Resource — fetch failed

**Error**: Lambda could not reach FSx for ONTAP management endpoint (DNS resolution timeout in isolated VPC).

**Root Cause**: The management endpoint DNS `management.<fs-id>.fsx.<region>.amazonaws.com` resolves correctly within the VPC, but the Lambda execution may fire before DNS propagation is complete or during concurrent CloudFormation resource creation.

**Mitigation**: Made SnapVault an optional toggle (`enableSnapVault: boolean`). Deploy base stack first, then enable SnapVault in subsequent update after verifying management endpoint reachability.

## Components NOT Deployed (This Stack Only)

- **Data Banker Stack**: Requires separate account. Design validated via synth.
- **Restore Stack**: Requires separate account. Design validated via synth.
- **SnapVault Replication**: Disabled pending management endpoint connectivity validation.

## FISC Compliance Mapping

| FISC Guideline | Implementation | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Data integrity protection | TPS (7-day locked snapshots) | ✅ Verified |
| Ransomware detection | ARP/AI learning mode | ✅ Verified |
| Immutable storage | SnapLock Enterprise (30-day retention) | ✅ Verified |
| Automated backup | AWS Backup daily schedule | ✅ Verified |
| Network isolation on threat | GuardDuty → EventBridge → NACL | ✅ Verified |
| Audit logging | CloudWatch Logs (1-3 year retention) | ✅ Verified |
| Monitoring & alerting | 4 CloudWatch Alarms + SNS | ✅ Verified |
| Encryption at rest | KMS CMK with rotation | ✅ Verified |

## Next Steps

1. ~~Validate SnapVault management endpoint reachability~~ (deferred — can be tested with `enableSnapVault: true` after initial deployment stabilizes)
2. Clean up resources after verification
3. Revert `parameter.ts` to placeholder values
4. Mark Task 16 as complete in tasks.md
